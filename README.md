# FlickrSearchAppDemo

The app displays images based on the user search term. For each picture there is a second screen that displays more information (where available):
person that uploaded the picture, date that it was uploaded, views and a description of the picture

The Flickr API (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) was used to retrieve the images and the respective information.
More specifically, the flickr.photos.search is used to retrieve the public photos and
flickr.photos.getInfo to retrieve information for a specific photo
